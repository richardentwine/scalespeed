# ToDo list to update tool

## Needs doing
- [x] Bug fix after being an idiot and using the wrong source files when checking changes in the browser. Easier than reverting back quite a few commits, hopefully. 
- [x] Switch away from var
- [x] Break up StopTime()
- [x] Change poor single character variable names
- [x] Amalgamate lessDetail() and moreDetail()
- [x] Amalgamate warningsOff() and warningsOn()
- [x] ClearData() refactor to DRY it
- [ ] Overhaul frontend
- [x] Remove global variables
- [ ] Review time recording method
- [ ] Add distance between "Clear table" and "Turn warnings on". Too close for comfort.
## Possible changes
- [ ] Change to TDD
